      This new license/exception request has been accepted and the information
      for the license/exception has been merged to the repository. Thank you to
      everyone who has participated!

      The license/exception will be published at https://spdx.org/licenses/ as
      part of the next SPDX License List release, which is expected to be in
      three months' time or sooner. In the interim, the new license will appear
      on the license list preview site at https://spdx.github.io/license-list-data/.
