         As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give
         you permission to link this library with independent modules to
         produce an executable, regardless of the license terms of these
         independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting
         executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also
         meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions
         of the license of that module. An independent module is a module
         which is not derived from or based on this library. If you modify
         this library, you may extend this exception to your version of
         the library, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not
         wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.
