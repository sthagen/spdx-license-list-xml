	EXEMPTION FOR BINARY LIBRARY-LIKE PACKAGES<br />
	------------------------------------------
	</p>

	<p>
	The second condition in the BSD licence (covering binary redistributions) does
	not apply all the way down a chain of software. If binary package A includes
	PCRE2, it must respect the condition, but if package B is software that
	includes package A, the condition is not imposed on package B unless it uses
	PCRE2 independently.
